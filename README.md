# Daily Standups

## JULY 30 2020

- Read about the docker first time. Then I went through the official website of docker hub and downloaded as the steps suggested. And ran the inital commands. Then I read about the purpose of why docker is used and the areas where it is used. 
- Docker serves the purpose of create, deploy and run applications by using containers. The containers encapsulate everything an application needs to run and it is limited to only those things.This allows the applications to run easily between changing environments. I read about the basic difference between a container and an image. 
- I used some commands such as for viewing how many containers or images are present and commands which are used to delete images and containers. Downloaded images like hello-world and ubuntu and nginx. The nginx server command showed some error as it shows the IP address of . But we have to use the ip address of the vm box. After solving errors through reading the guide, all the commands worked nicely.
